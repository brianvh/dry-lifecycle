# Dry::Lifecycle

A StateMachine implementation designed to fit in with the [dry-rb][http://dry-rb.org/] family of gems. Provides a DSL for specifying the allowed state values that an
object can have, as well as which stats are allowed _exits_ from the current state. Exit state transitions can be guarded.

You define your Lifecycle, and then send your object (which must have a :state attribute), and the new state you want the object to be in, to the #call method of your Lifecycle instance. If the transition succeeds, Lifecycle returns a dry-monads `Success()` instance, wrapping the object in its new state. Otherwise, it returns a `Failure()` instance, wrapping either the exception that was raised, or the String messages of the failing guard classes.

## Installation

```ruby
gem 'dry-lifecycle', git: 'https://github.com/hashrabbit/dry-lifecycle.git'
